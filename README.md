# Paediatric-Dosing

 This is an HTML5 Paediatric Dosing Calculator designed for use in New Zealand.
 
 It was built for www.ellersliemedical.co.nz,  www.healthnavigator.org.nz and my personal website www.jackofallorgans.com
 
 I am happy for others to use it as long as you contact me: http://www.jackofallorgans.com/contact/
 
 It runs stand alone, no dependencies, and is vanilla javascript. Simply enter the weight and choose the drug
 
 It doesn't work on old internet explorer version (10 and below)
